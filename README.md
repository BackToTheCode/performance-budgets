# The problem

Lighthouse now supports budgets. To use this feature you can run this easily within a browser. But there is no easy way to run this on CI without creating your own docker image.

# This solution

This tool was designed to help developers quickly run performance budgets against any given website. `lighthouse-budgets` allows to to focus on your code and the performance rather than the setup of the tools surrounding it.

# Getting Started

_Make sure you have docker running_

```sh
git clone https://github.com/boyney123/lighthouse-budgets.git
```

```sh
cd lighthouse-budgets && docker build -t lighthouse-budgets .
```

```sh
docker run -v $(pwd)/example/config:/usr/src/lighthouse-budgets/src/config lighthouse-budgets {url}

#Example
docker run -v $(pwd)/example/config:/usr/src/lighthouse-budgets/src/config lighthouse-budgets https://youtube.com


```

Once you run the container, an instance of chrome will run inside the container with lighthouse installed. Lighthouse will take your given budget configuration file and make sure the website is within budget.

The docker container will exit with logs if you are over budget!
