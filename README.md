## The problem

Every feature we add has an impact on the performance of our applications and can effect the end user experience. Performance budgets are a great way to keep your applications fast.

There is currently a lot of work going on around web performance and some new awesome features coming out.

[Addy Osmani has written a great article on performance budgets](https://addyosmani.com/blog/performance-budgets/), and he says...

> Performance budgets usher a culture of accountability that enable stakeholders to weigh the impact to user-centric metrics of each change to a site. Talk to your organization and see if you can get by in to adopt performance budgets for your projects. If it's worth getting fast, it's worth staying fast. ‚ù§Ô∏è

[Lighthouse](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse/) has recently come out with a [great feature](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse/audits/budgets) that allows you to capture and set budgets on a given website.

## This solution

`performance-budgets` was built from inspiration from these articles and built to give developers an easy way to get started with performance budgets.

`performance-budgets` was built with continuous-integration in mind, allowing developers to run one command to check budgets against any given url.

_In the future we hope to add more features to the project and start to monitor other stats._
